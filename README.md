dnscap
======

dnscap is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS traffic. 
It produces binary data in pcap(3) format or text output like dig. 
This utility is similar to tcpdump(1), but has a number of features 
tailored to DNS transactions and protocol options.

For more information about dnscap check the [OARC website](https://www.dns-oarc.net/tools/dnscap).
