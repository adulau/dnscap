.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS traffic.  It
normally produces binary data in
.Xr pcap 3
format, either on standard output or in successive dump files
(based on the
.Fl d
command line option.)  This utility is similar to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
but has finer grained packet recognition tailored to DNS transactions and
protocol options.
.Nm
is expected to be used for gathering continuous research or audit traces.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl a
Puts the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that even without this option,
the interface could be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.
.It Fl v
Tells a verbose story of options and patterns chosen, files opened, and so on.
.It Fl f
Flush the
.Xr pcap 3
packet dump after every packet.  Mostly this is useful when the
packet dump is standard output, and has been piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.It Fl g
Produce
.Xr dig 1 -like
output on diagnostic output, showing the presentation form of DNS messages
which passed through all of the filters.  If
.Fl d
is also used, then every message will be dumped in both binary and
presentation form.
.It Fl ?
Prints some text to stdout describing the command line options, so that you
won't have to refer back to this man page as often.  Probably you will have
to say "-\\?" to get this option past your shell.
.It Fl 6
Suppress the use of packet filter patterns that are known (as of 2007) to
cause problems when processing IPv6 packets.  Recommended when IPv6 traffic is
expected to be present.
.It Fl i Ar if
Select an interface to be monitored.  On BSD systems, the default is the first
interface that was configured at system boot time.  On Linux systems, the
default is to monitor all interfaces.  More than one interface may be selected
which will cause output to be interleaved from all selected interfaces.  If
multiple interfaces are selected having disparite datalink types (framing),
then the output datalink will be demoted to DLT_LOOP (protocol family only,
no link layer source/destination addresses or other framing information.)
.It Fl o Ar file
Select an offline
.Xr pcap 3
file produced by this utility or by
.Xr tcpdump 1
as the input packet source.  Can be given as "-" to indicate standard input.
.It Fl l Ar vlan
Captures only 802.1Q encapsulated packets, and selects specific vlans to be
monitored.  Can be specified more than once to select multiple vlans.
.It Fl p Ar port
Capture only packets on this UDP port, and treat as DNS traffic.  The default
port is 53.
.It Fl m Op quire
Capture only packets containing designated message types (query, update,
initiation, response, and error).  Default is query initiation and responses.
An "error" means a non-zero RCODE or a truncation (TC) flag.
.It Fl h Op ir
Hide initiator or responder of each captured transaction.  Hiding an initiator
means wiping out the address and port number.  Hiding a responder means to wipe
out the address only.  This wiping occurs on the copy of the packet sent to the
.Xr pcap 3
dump output, and both the IP and UDP checksums will be recomputed in that case.
.It Fl q Ar host
Capture only transactions having these initiators.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple initiators.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl r Ar host
Capture only transactions having these responders.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple responders.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl d Ar base
Dump the captured packets to successive binary files in
.Xr pcap 3
format.  Each file will have a name like "%s.%u.%06u" where %s is
.Ar base ,
%u is the time in seconds, and %06u is the time in microseconds.  The argument
"-" may be given (so, "-d -") to send the binary output to standard output.
In that case, the
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
options affect the total duration of the capture, and not merely the size and
time limits of each individual dump file.
.It Fl k Ar cmd
After each dump file specified by
.Fl d
is closed, this command will be executed in a nonblocking subprocess with the
file name as its one argument.  It's expected that this command will be a shell
script that submits the finished file to a batch processing analytics system.
.It Fl t Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file after 86400 seconds (one day).  A shorter or
longer time can be chosen with the
.Fl t
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output, then after closing this
file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl c .
.It Fl c Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file after writing 1000000000 (one billion)
packets.  A larger or smaller dump file size can be chosen with the
.Fl c
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output, then after closing this
file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl t .
.It Fl x Ar pat
If one or more
.Fl x
options are provided, then DNS messages will only be selected if their
presentation format representation matches at least one of the provided
.Ar pat
patterns.  See
.Xr regex 3
and
.Xr re_format 7
for more information about extended regular expression syntax.
.El
.Pp
If started up with no options,
.Nm
will exit with a complaint that without either the
.Fl d
or
.Fl g
options, it's pointless to run the program at all.  In its simplest form,
the output can be piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1
as in:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -d - | tcpdump -r -
.Ed
.Pp
You can safely add the
.Fl v
option since the output resulting from
.Fl v
goes to diagnostic output rather than standard output.  And since everybody
who's anybody always uses the
.Fl n
option to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
the minimum useful incantation is probably:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -v -d - | tcpdump -r - -n
.Ed
.Pp
The more interesting use for
.Nm
is long term or continuous data collection.  Assuming a shell script called
.Ar dnscap-upload
whose function is to transfer a
.Xr pcap 3 -
format file to an analytics system and then remove the local copy of it, then
a name server operating system startup could invoke
.Nm
for continuous DNS auditing using a command like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -m quire -h i -r f.root-servers.net \\
       -d /var/local/dnscaps/f-root -t 1800 \\
       -k /usr/local/sbin/dnscap-upload
