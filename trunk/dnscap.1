.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS traffic.  It
produces binary data in
.Xr pcap 3
format, either on standard output (by default) or in successive dump files
(if the
.Fl d
command line option is given.)  This utility is similar to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
but has finer grained packet recognition tailored to DNS transactions and
protocol options.
.Nm
is expected to be used for gathering continuous research or audit traces.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl a
Puts the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that even without this option,
the interface could be in promiscuous mode for some other reason.
.It Fl v
Tells a verbose story of options and patterns chosen, files opened, and so on.
.It Fl f
Flush the
.Xr pcap 3
packet dump after every packet.  Mostly this is useful when the
packet dump is standard output (the default), and has been piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.It Fl 6
Avoid patterns which depend on correctly functioning kernel BPF engines.  Most
such engines at least through 2007 have bugs in analyzing IPv6 packets.
.It Fl i Ar if
Select an interface to be monitored.  On BSD systems, the default is the first
interface that was configured at system boot time.  On Linux systems, the
default is to monitor all interfaces.  More than one interface may be selected
which will cause output to be interleaved from all selected interfaces.  If
multiple interfaces are selected having disparite datalink types (framing),
then the output datalink will be demoted to DLT_LOOP (protocol family only).
.It Fl l Ar vlan
Captures only 802.1Q encapsulated packets, and selects specific vlans to be
monitored.  Can be specified more than once to select multiple vlans.
.It Fl p Ar port
Capture only packets on this UDP port, and treat as DNS traffic.  The default
port is 53.
.It Fl m Op quire
Capture only packets containing designated message types (query, update,
initiation, response, and error).  Default is query initiation and responses.
An "error" means a non-zero RCODE or a truncation (TC) flag.
.It Fl h Op ir
Hide initiator or responder of each captured transaction.  Hiding an initiator
means wiping out the address and port number.  Hiding a responder means to wipe
out the address only.  The wiping occurs on the copy of the packet sent to the
.Xr pcap 3
dump output, and both the IP and UDP checksums will be recomputed in that case.
.It Fl q Ar host
Capture only transactions having these initiators.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple initiators.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl r Ar host
Capture only transactions having these responders.  Can be specified more than
once to select multiple responders.  If a host name is used, then all of that
host's addresses whether IPv4 or IPv6 are added to the recognition pattern.
.It Fl d Ar base
Dump the captured packets to files rather than to standard output.  Each file
will have a name like "%s.%u.%09u" where %s is
.Ar base ,
%u is the time in seconds, and %09u is the time in microseconds.
.It Fl k Ar cmd
After each dump file specified by
.Fl d
is closed, this command will be executed in a nonblocking subprocess with the
file name as its one argument.  It's expected that this command will be a shell
script that submits the finished file to a batch processing analytics system.
.It Fl t Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file after 86400 seconds (one day).  A shorter or
longer time can be chosen with the
.Fl t
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output (the default), then after
closing this file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl c .
.It Fl c Ar lim
By default,
.Nm
will close its packet dump file after writing 1000000000 (one billion)
packets.  A larger or smaller dump file size can be chosen with the
.Fl c
option.  If the packet dump file is standard output (the default), then after
closing this file,
.Nm
exits.  This option is inclusive with
.Fl t .
.El
.Pp
If started up with no options,
.Nm
will immediately begin spewing binary data to its standard output.  This is
almost never desireable, and at a minimum, it's recommended that the output
be piped to
.Xr tcpdump 1
as in:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap | tcpdump -r -
.Ed
.Pp
You can safely add the
.Fl v
option since the output resulting from that option goes to diagnostic output
rather than standard output.  And since everybody who's anybody always uses
the
.Fl n
option to
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
the minimum useful incantation is probably:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -v | tcpdump -r - -n
.Ed
.Pp
The more interesting use for
.Nm
is long term or continuous data collection.  Assuming a shell script called
.Ar dnscap-upload
whose job was to transfer a
.Xr pcap 3 -
format file to an analytics system and remove it, then a root name server
operating system startup could invoke
.Nm dnscap
for continuous DNS auditing using a command like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dnscap -m quire -h i -r f.root-servers.net \\
       -d /var/local/dnscaps/f-root -t 1800 \\
       -k /usr/local/sbin/dnscap-upload
