Readme for Linux installations.

Building and installing DNSCAP requires that bind 9 and pcap be
installed.  For bind 9.4.1 I specified

./configure  --with-libtool \
              --disable-threads \
              --disable-openssl-version-check \
              --enable-libbind \
              --prefix=/usr/local/bind \
              --sysconfdir=/etc \
              --localstatedir=/var

enable-libbind is necessary so that the bind libraries will be
built and installed.  disable-openssl-version-check is probably
necessary because the vendor supplied updates to openssl will
have strange numbers that won't pass the checks in configure.

pcap will probably already be installed.  if not you can add it
using via rpm.

You'll probably need to edit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
and add a file so that ld processing will be able to find
the bind libraries.  I added added a file called local.conf
with contents

/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/bind/lib

then run ldconfig as root after you've built and installed
bind.

Building DNSCAP is now something like:

  mkdir dnscap
  cd dnscap
  tar -zxf /path-to-dnscap.tar.gz
  cd dnscap
  make
  cp dnscap.1 /usr/local/man/man1
  cp dnscap /usr/local/sbin

comment on fedora core 6
this is a redhat varient.   the bind libraries will be present if
dns server is selected.  isc-config.sh will not be.  an alias will
be needed from /usr/bin/isc-config.sh to wherever it is installed.

it may be necessary to install the pcap development libraries
even if the base pcap is installed to get pcap.h for compile.
