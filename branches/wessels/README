Linking with libbind

    If you plan to use dnscap's -x/-X features, then you might need
    to have libbind installed.   These features use functions such
    as ns_parserr().  On some systems these functions will be found
    in libresolv.  If not, then you might need to install libbind.
    I suggest first building dnscap on your system as-is, then run

	$ ./dnscap -x foo

    If you see an error, install libbind either from your
    OS package system or by downloading the source from
    http://www.isc.org/downloads/current

64-bit libraries

    If you need to link against 64-bit libraries found in non-standard
    locations, provide the location by setting LDFLAGS before running
    configure:

	$ env LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64 ./configure


FreeBSD (and other BSDs?)

    If you've installed libbind for -x/-X then it probably went into
    /usr/local and you'll need to tell configure how to find it:

	$ env CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure

    Also note that we have observed significant memory leaks on FreeBSD
    (7.2) when using -x/-X.  To rectify:

	1. cd /usr/ports/dns/libbind
	2. make config
	3. de-select "Compile with thread support"
	4. reinstall the libbind port
	5. recompile and install dnscap
